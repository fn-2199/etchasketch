Project: Etch-a-Sketch from TheOdinProject

This is the fourth project assigned by The Odin Project. This is probably the most fun project I've worked on so far. Since we are to code our own Etch-a-Sketch from scratch, I decided to shape its GUI to the actual Etch-a-Sketch product. The box-shadow css property was the tool that made the GUI pop and look 3D. The spinning transformation for the clear and size button also gave it a nice touch. 

Some new features I learned that was outside of the project's requirements were the html color picker, CSS's transition and transform, and the grid layout. I decided to use the grid layout instead of flexbox as it seems to be the most efficient way to append elements in rows and columns. Another feature I implemented was highlighting the current paint mode by adding a class that makes the buttons glow.
